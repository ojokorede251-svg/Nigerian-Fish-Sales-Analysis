# Nigerian-Fish-Sales-Analysis (2019-2023)
Power BI dashboard analyzing ₦22M+ in Nigerian fish store sales (2019–2023) | Portfolio Project by Ojo Korede Kelvin | SQL, Excel, Power BI".
Insights from ₦22M+ in Nigerian aquaculture retail transactions
This project analyzes 5 years of Nigerian fish store data, uncovering trends in sales, customer types, and regional demand. Built as part of my data analysis journey—perfect for fintech, e-com, or agrotech gigs in Lagos/Abuja.

## Key Insights
- **Top Performer**: Catfish leads with ₦6.1M (27% of total sales), strongest in Abuja (₦2.2M).
- **Regional Leader**: Port Harcourt tops at ₦7.6M, driven by Tilapia (₦2.3M)—likely local sourcing edge.
- **Opportunity**: Lagos balanced but low Tilapia—boost with targeted stocking/marketing.
- **Total Revenue**: ₦22.4M across 1,826 transactions.
- **Recommendation**: Prioritize Catfish in Abuja, Tilapia in Port Harcourt for max profit.

## Tools & Skills Used
- **Data Cleaning & Pivots**: Excel
- **Queries**: SQL (for aggregation, though optional here)
- **Visualization**: Power BI (interactive dashboard with slicers, buttons for Sales/Net Profit views)
